### 🧠 **Open-Source Large Language Models (LLMs)**  
*(For those who want to save the world… or at least automate their philosophy homework.)*

- **Llama 3** (Meta)  
  → Semi-open license, commercial use allowed… but with terms vaguer than a dream after three Red Bulls.

- **Mistral 7B / Mixtral 8x7B / Mistral Large** (Mistral AI)  
  → French, elegant, and energy-efficient. Mixtral? It’s like having 8 brains… but only one picks up the bill.

- **Qwen** (Alibaba)  
  → China’s answer to the rest of the world. Qwen-72B struts in wearing an open-source suit—and a surprisingly permissive license.

- **Gemma** (Google)  
  → “Open source”… in quotes. More like “open-ish.” Free as a fish… in a locked aquarium.

- **Phi-3** (Microsoft)  
  → Tiny but mighty. Almost open… except you need an Azure account to access some weights. So free. So open.

- **OLMo** (Allen Institute)  
  → The holy grail: code, data, training logs—everything’s public. Transparent as your future after your fifth coffee.

- **Command R+** (Cohere)  
  → Even Cohere cracked. Open for commercial use, optimized for RAG and agentic workflows. Turns out even capitalists crave a little community.

### 🖼️ **Open-Source Image Generation Models**  
*(For generating cyborg unicorns in tuxedos… because the world clearly needs that.)*

- **Stable Diffusion 3 / SDXL / SD 1.5** (Stability AI)  
  → The classic. Open weights, commercial use often allowed—but double-check the version before selling your soul.

- **FLUX.1** (Black Forest Labs)  
  → Hyper-realistic… but not *truly* open. Sorry, *yoyo*—you’re staying outside.

- **DALL·E Mini / Craiyon**  
  → Open, yes… but the images look like what your cat would draw if it had a keyboard.

- **Kandinsky 2.2 / 3.0** (Sber AI)  
  → Russian, open, and surprisingly capable. Like a matryoshka doll full of useful features… and vodka.

### 🗣️ **Audio / Speech / TTS Models**  
*(So your AI can talk in Morgan Freeman’s voice… or that of a depressed robot.)*

- **Whisper** (OpenAI)  
  → The ultimate irony: OpenAI gave us one of the most genuinely open models. Audio-to-text transcription, free and everywhere.

- **Bark** (Suno)  
  → Generates speech, music, laughter… sometimes hauntingly. But it’s open source! So it’s cool.

- **Coqui TTS**  
  → A fully open-source TTS framework. Train it on your own voice—if you dare to listen to yourself.

### 🧪 **Other / Specialized Models**  
*(Because the world needs more than just AIs that say “hello” in 42 languages.)*

- **Nomic Embed**  
  → Ultra-compact open embeddings. For when you want to shove an AI into a floppy disk.

- **Sentence-Transformers**  
  → Loyal as a golden retriever. Encodes sentences, never judges your life choices.

- **Llama.cpp**  
  → Not a model, but lets you run Llama on a toaster. Almost literally.

- **Falcon** (TII UAE)  
  → Falcon-180B was a giant… but the commercial license? A proper oriental puzzle.

- **BLOOM** (BigScience)  
  → The multilingual big sibling, 100% open, built by the community. Because unity makes strength… or at least a decent README.
