# 🚀 List of open sources AI.

> Un modèle d’intelligence artificielle dont le code source, les poids (weights), l’architecture, et parfois même les données d’entraînement sont librement accessibles, modifiables et redistribuables par quiconque — contrairement aux modèles propriétaires (comme ceux de certaines GAFAM) qui te disent "fais confiance, on est gentils" tout en verrouillant le coffre-fort avec un NDA de 87 pages.

## 📖 Description
A list of all open source AIs and their models (i think)

🧠 Open-Source Large Language Models (LLMs)
(The ones everyone fine-tunes hoping to become the next Zuckerberg… or at least automate their homework.)

Llama 3 (Meta)
→ Semi-open license (yes, it’s messy), but allows commercial use under conditions. The current darling of the scene.
Mistral 7B / Mixtral 8x7B / Mistral Large (partially) (Mistral AI)
→ French, efficient, and far more polite than certain American models. Mixtral is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE): like having 8 brains that take turns working to save electricity.
Qwen (Alibaba)
→ China’s answer to everyone else. Qwen-72B holds its own, with a surprisingly permissive license.
Gemma (Google)
→ Small, cute… and open source? Let’s say “open-ish.” The license is restrictive, but hey—Google’s trying.
Phi-3 (Microsoft)
→ Tiny model, huge performance. Almost open source… except you need an Azure account to access some weights. So open. So free. 😏
OLMo (Allen Institute)
→ Truly open: code, data, training logs—everything’s public. The holy grail of transparency.
Command R+ (Cohere)
→ Open for commercial use, optimized for RAG and agentic workflows. Yes, even Cohere cracked.


🖼️ Open-Source Image Generation Models
(For generating cyborg unicorns in tuxedos… because the world clearly needs that.)

Stable Diffusion 3 / SDXL / SD 1.5 (Stability AI)
→ The classic. Open weights, commercial use allowed (check the version).
FLUX.1 (Black Forest Labs)
→ New, hyper-realistic… but not fully open. Sorry, yoyo.
DALL·E Mini / Craiyon
→ Open, but… charmingly amateurish—like a child’s crayon drawing.
Kandinsky 2.2 / 3.0 (Sber AI)
→ Russian, open, surprisingly capable. Like a matryoshka doll full of features.


🗣️ Audio / Speech / TTS Models
(So your AI can talk in Morgan Freeman’s voice… or that of a depressed robot.)

Whisper (OpenAI)
→ The irony: OpenAI gave us one of the most genuinely open models. Audio-to-text transcription, free and everywhere.
Bark (Suno)
→ Generates speech, music, laughter… sometimes unsettling, but open source.
Coqui TTS
→ A full open-source framework for text-to-speech. Train it on your own voice—if you dare.


🧪 Other / Specialized Models
Nomic Embed – Ultra-compact open embeddings.
Sentence-Transformers – Reliable sentence encoders. Loyal as a golden retriever.
Llama.cpp – Not a model, but lets you run Llama on a toaster. Almost.
Falcon (TII UAE) – Falcon-180B was a giant… but commercial license? Complicated.
BLOOM (BigScience) – The multilingual big sibling, 100% open, built by the community.


❗ Heads up, yoyo:
“Open source” Some models are source-available (e.g., Llama): you can see the code, but you can’t sell it or spy on your neighbors with it.
Others are open weights only: you get the model weights, but not the training data or full training pipeline.
Always check the license before launching your startup from your bedroom.
