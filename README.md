## <a name="llms"></a>🧠 Large Language Models (LLMs)

*(For those who want to save the world… or at least automate their philosophy homework.)*

| Model | Author | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **BLOOM** | BigScience | The multilingual big sibling, 100% open, built by the community. Because unity makes strength… or at least a decent README. |
| **Command R+** | Cohere | Even Cohere cracked. Open for commercial use, optimized for RAG and agentic workflows. Turns out even capitalists crave a little community. |
| **Falcon** | TII UAE | Falcon-180B was a giant… but the commercial license? A proper oriental puzzle. |
| **Gemma** | Google | "Open source"… in quotes. More like "open-ish." Free as a fish… in a locked aquarium. |
| **Llama 3** | Meta | Semi-open license, commercial use allowed… but with terms vaguer than a dream after three Red Bulls. |
| **Mistral 7B / Mixtral 8x7B / Mistral Large** | Mistral AI | French, elegant, and energy-efficient. Mixtral? It's like having 8 brains… but only one picks up the bill. |
| **OLMo** | Allen Institute | The holy grail: code, data, training logs—everything's public. Transparent as your future after your fifth coffee. |
| **Phi-3** | Microsoft | Tiny but mighty. Almost open… except you need an Azure account to access some weights. So free. So open. |
| **Qwen** | Alibaba | China's answer to the rest of the world. Qwen-72B struts in wearing an open-source suit—and a surprisingly permissive license. |

## <a name="images"></a>🖼️ Image Generation

*(For generating cyborg unicorns in tuxedos… because the world clearly needs that.)*

| Model | Author | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **DALL·E Mini / Craiyon** | - | Open, yes… but the images look like what your cat would draw if it had a keyboard. |
| **FLUX.1** | Black Forest Labs | Hyper-realistic… but not *truly* open. Sorry, *yoyo*—you're staying outside. |
| **Kandinsky 2.2 / 3.0** | Sber AI | Russian, open, and surprisingly capable. Like a matryoshka doll full of useful features… and vodka. |
| **Stable Diffusion 3 / SDXL / SD 1.5** | Stability AI | The classic. Open weights, commercial use often allowed—but double-check the version before selling your soul. |

## <a name="audio"></a>🗣️ Audio / Speech / TTS

*(So your AI can talk in Morgan Freeman's voice… or that of a depressed robot.)*

| Model | Author | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Bark** | Suno | Generates speech, music, laughter… sometimes hauntingly. But it's open source! So it's cool. |
| **Coqui TTS** | - | A fully open-source TTS framework. Train it on your own voice—if you dare to listen to yourself. |
| **Whisper** | OpenAI | The ultimate irony: OpenAI gave us one of the most genuinely open models. Audio-to-text transcription, free and everywhere. |

## <a name="specialized"></a>🧪 Specialized Models

*(Because the world needs more than just AIs that say "hello" in 42 languages.)*

| Model | Author | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Falcon** | TII UAE | Falcon-180B was a giant… but the commercial license? A real mystery. |
| **Llama.cpp** | - | Not a model, but lets you run Llama on a toaster. Almost literally. |
| **Nomic Embed** | - | Ultra-compact open embeddings. For when you want to shove an AI into a floppy disk. |
| **Sentence-Transformers** | - | Loyal as a golden retriever. Encodes sentences, never judges your life choices. |

*There you have it! It's clean, it's sorted alphabetically by category, and it preserves all the original sarcastic flavor. Because well-organized sarcasm is always better than chaotic mess. 🎩✨*
